    * **Description:** EO Browser makes it possible to browse and compare full resolution images from all the data sources we provide. You simply go to your area of interest, select your desired time range and cloud coverage, and inspect the resulting data in the browser. Try out different visualizations or make your own, download high resolution images and create timelapses.

        Sentinel Hub services are providing long-term analysis in an efficient way. We keep EO Browser, our showcase of Sentinel Hub functionality free to use, to make these features available to just about anyone. Some of the most exciting new EO Browser features are collected in our Medium blog posts from March 2020 and July 2020.
