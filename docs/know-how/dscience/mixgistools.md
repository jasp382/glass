    * **Description:** GemPy is a tool for generating 3D structural geological models in Python. As such, it enables you to create complex combinations of stratigraphical and structural features such as folds, faults, and unconformities. It was furthermore designed to enable probabilistic modeling to address parameter and model uncertainties.
